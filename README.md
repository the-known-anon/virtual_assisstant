# Virtual Assistant using python
This has been created using python, I have taken inspiration from **GeeksForGeeks** website and tried inserting this functionality into a GUI that I have also created using **Wx** in python.
Another functionality that I have added is that, the user can activate the assistant by pressing the space bar so that it is easier to use :)
